Part 1 â€“ Quality Score Distribution per-nucleotide

Initial data exploration:
used:
$ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | less -S
to take a precursory look at the fastq file
Don't do a wc -l on the login node, if we want a line count, do it in an interactive session
the file is more than 300 million reads
$ ls -lah
    total 47G

these are gigantic files. 
to get the read length:
    $ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc
            1       1     102 #include new line character
    $ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc
            1       1     9
    $ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc
            1       1     9
    $ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | head -2 | tail -1 | wc
            1       1     102

First read in each file from same location, headers all look the same except for counter [1,4]
Must read all at the same time. 
The indexes / barcodes will be found at the beginning and ends of the line?
is it the barcode itself at the beginning and rev comp at the end?
taking a look at one of the barcodes:
$ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | grep "^CACTTCAC"
    CACTTCACCTAGAAAGTGCAAAATTCTTTGTTTTATGAATAAAATATAAGATAACACAAAATGTTTCAGAATGTATAGCCTTTGTTGGTTGGAGATGATTT
    CACTTCACTCTGTACCTGTAGCAAGGTCTGCCAACTCTATGGCTGCCGCACATGCATCTGGCCCTCCCTCTCTGTCCTGGGGTCCTCAGCGTGCTGTCTCC
    CACTTCACGAGAGGACAAATGCCACCTCTCAGCTGCATCTTGAAGCTGGTCACTTCTGGGTCTGTGGCAGGCATTCGTCAATGGCCCAGTGCAGTTCTCTG

i don't see the barcode at the end though...

to test whether it's phred 33 or 64:
$ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '4~4p' | grep -E "[a-z]+"

this did not return any results, so there are no lower case letters, which would indicate the encoding is 33

Also, # are only in 33, not 64, so it's another one to grep for. 

wrote rev_comp function in both bioinfo.py and python script for qscore Distribution
